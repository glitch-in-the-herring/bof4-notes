Tracing is the one of the most important skills in hacking. It is the process of looking through hundreds of thousands of lines of code and figuring out what the instructions do.
## Preparations
### Emulator
The emulator that I use for tracing is PCSX-Redux. Previously, I had to use PCSXTrace (https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/236), which was slow and time-consuming since PCSXTrace had no memory viewer or breakpoints: you had to start tracing when you *feel* that the relevant instructions are being executed. 

### What to look for
