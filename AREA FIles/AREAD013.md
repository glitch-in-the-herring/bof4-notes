This is the area where Nina first meets Ryu.
* After Nina gives Ryu the King's Sword, the game also equips him with his first piece of armor. This is set at `0x000a6b34` (`0x801f0b34` in the RAM). By default, this is Clothing.
* There are no portals in this area, not even one that leads back to the world map.
