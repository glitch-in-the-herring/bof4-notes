Noritake-san's Town (のりたけさんのまち *Noritake-san no Machi*) is an unused area. 
![[Noritake-san's Town.png]]
## Portals
The houses do not have any functioning portals. The door of the blue house has a broken door texture, as you are able to go through it as if it were not there. The western and northern roads lead to the [[AREAD068|outdoor area of the Dengeki Store]].
* The data for the northern portal is located at
	* `BIN/WORLD/AREAM019.EMI: 000848a8` in the file
	* `0x801f08a8` in the RAM
* The data for the western portal is located at:
	* `BIN/WORLD/AREAM019.EMI: 000848b4` in the file
	* `0x801f08b4` in the RAM
## NPCs
The dialogues are all left untranslated in Japanese, so trying to talk to anyone in the English versions will show nothing but gibberish. Almost all NPCs say "かいわ" (会話 *kaiwa*) , which is Japanese for "conversation". The exceptions are:
* The two Rhoppe clones standing next to the blue house. They act as storekeepers.
* The chicken in front of the blue house, who says "のりたけさんのまち" (*Noritake no Machi*), the name of the area.
* The short-hair male grassrunner. He says Gyosil's lines:
```
ギョシル
「うひょー
あんちゃん、つりはすきかー

つりこそ男のロマンだへ
あんちゃんも
そうおもうっぺか？

もし、いがったら
あんちゃんに、オラのテクを

教えてやっても、いいけんど..
どうだい？きょう味あるっぺ？

	あるっぺ
	うんにゃー、ないっぺよ
```
* There is a random horse a bit to the northeast of the area. You cannot get to it without using hacks. Of course, it also says "かいわ"

### Store
You can only open the store from the Rhoppe at the front. He sells:
* Healing Herb
* Vitamin
* MultiVitamin
* SuperVitamin (The only place where you can buy it)
* King's Sword (The only place where you can buy it)
* LeatherArmor
* Chain Cap
* Bandana
The data for the store can be found at:
* `BIN/SYSTEM/SHOP.EMI: 000329a8` in the file
* `0x801af9a8` in the RAM
## Unused Textures
* A texture for a Whelk
* A texture for Momo
	* Related to this is the fact that this AREA file also contains the reward table for the masters.
## Yukiko Noritake
Yukiko Noritake (則武由子 *Noritake Yukiko*) is credited as a texture designer in Breath of Fire III
![[Breath of Fire III Credits.png]]
She(?) is given special thanks at the end of Breath of Fire IV's credits (third name in the leftmost column)
![[Breath of Fire IV Credits.png]]
The absence of her name elsewhere in the credits suggests that she wasn't a member of Breath of Fire IV's development team. Nothing else is otherwise known about her.
